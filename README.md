# Machine_Learning_Project
This project is a group project that falls under the subject of Machine Learning (Unsupervised learning). In this project, Our team built k-means and DBSCAN models from scratch. K-means and DBSCAN are popular clustering algorithms in machine learning used to partition data into groups based on similarity.
